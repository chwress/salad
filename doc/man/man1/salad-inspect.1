.IP "\(bu" 2
The number of new/ unseen n-grams
.IP "\(bu" 2
The number of unique n-grams
.IP "\(bu" 2
The total number of n-grams
.IP "\(bu" 2
The length of the sample in number of bytes
.PP
.PP
This in turn can be used to make a point how well and if anomaly detection is suitable for this particular data set or classification might be the better choice in this setting\&.
