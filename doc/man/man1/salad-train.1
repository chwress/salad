.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
salad train [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Trains a detector based on n-grams extracted from the provided data which might be given in various \fIinput format\fPs\&. The detector is here represented as Bloom filter of a specific \fIsize\fP that gets populated by the extracted n-grams\&. The \fIlength\fP of the n-gram is indicated by the variable n\&. For the type of n-gram it is possible to choose between byte and word n-grams indicated by the \fIn-gram delimiter\fP\&. Thereby \fBSalad\fP implements the general bag-of-words model\&.
.PP
Bloom filters basically are associative bit arrays\&. Therefore, \fBSalad\fP is restricted to the binary embedding of n-grams, that is, the representation of the pure Boolean occurrence of such n-grams\&. The actual mapping of an n-gram to the index within the bit array is achieved by hashing the n-gram value\&. To do so \fBSalad\fP offers two different \fIhash sets\fP: (1) three fundamentally different hash functions and (2) three differently seeded instances of the murmur hash function\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.SS "I/O Options:"
\fB-i, --input <file>\fP
.RS 4
The input filename\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB-f, --input-format <fmt>\fP
.RS 4
Sets the format of input\&. This option might be one of 'lines', 'files', 'archive', 'network' or 'network-dump'\&. This depends on the configure Salad was compiled with -- cf\&. USE_ARCHIVES, USE_NETWORK, ALLOW_LIVE_TRAINING\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB-p, --pcap-filter <str>\fP
.RS 4
Filter expression for the PCAP library in case network data is processed (Default: tcp)\&. This option is only available if Salad was compiled with network support -- cf\&. USE_NETWORK\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Feature Options:"
\fB-n, --ngram-len <num>\fP
.RS 4
Set length of n-grams (Default: 3)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB-d, --ngram-delim <delim>\fP
.RS 4
Set delimiters for the use of words n-grams\&. If omitted or empty byte n-grams are used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB-s, --filter-size <num>\fP
.RS 4
Set the size of the bloom filter as bits of the index (Default: 24)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB--hash-set <hashes>\fP
.RS 4
Set the hash set to be used: 'simple' or 'murmur' (Default: 'simple')\&.
